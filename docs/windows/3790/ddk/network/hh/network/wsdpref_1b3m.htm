</DL>

<P>Note that a SAN service provider does not support the WSAEINPROGRESS error code for <B>WSPIoctl</B> because the switch never issues cancel blocking calls to a SAN service provider.</P>

<P>Note that if <B>WSPIoctl</B> returns zero and the operation completed immediately, the completion routine, if specified, will have already been queued. </P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The Windows Sockets switch calls a SAN service provider's <B>WSPIoctl</B> function to set or retrieve operating parameters associated with a socket. </P>

<P>A call to <B>WSPIoctl</B> using any supported input/output control (IOCTL) code might block indefinitely, depending on the SAN service provider's implementation. Because the switch cannot tolerate blocking in some <B>WSPIoctl</B> calls, it uses overlapped I/O for IOCTL codes that are especially likely to block, including the following supported IOCTL codes: </P>

<P class=indent1>SIO_GET_QOS</P>

<P class=indent1>SIO_GET_GROUP_QOS</P>

<P class=indent1>SIO_SET_QOS</P>

<P class=indent1>SIO_SET_GROUP_QOS</P>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If socket <I>s</I> is in nonblocking mode, <B>WSPIoctl</B> returns the WSAEWOULDBLOCK error code if the SAN service provider cannot finish the specified operation immediately. In this case, the Windows Sockets switch must change the socket to blocking mode and reissue the request. </P>

<P>Because IOCTL codes are 32-bit entities, the following encoding scheme partitions the identifier space for each IOCTL code so vendors can add new IOCTL codes. Each column in the following table specifies the number of bits in each partition of an IOCTL-code. </P>

<DT><B>00</B></DT>

<DD>The IOCTL code is a standard Unix IOCTL code, as with FIONREAD, FIONBIO, and so on.</DD>

<DD>The IOCTL code applies only to a specific SAN service provider. This type allows vendors to be assigned a number that appears in the <B>Vendor/address family</B> field.

<DD>An 11-bit quantity that defines the vendor who owns the code (if <B>T</B> == <B>3</B>) or that contains the address family to which the code applies (if <B>T</B> == <B>2</B>). If the IOCTL code is a standard Unix IOCTL code (<B>T</B> == <B>0</B>), this field has the same value as the code on Unix. If this is a generic Windows Sockets 2 IOCTL code (<B>T</B> == <B>1</B>), this field can be used as an extension of the IOCTL-code field to provide additional code values.</DD>

<DT><B>IOCTL Code</B></DT>

<DD>The specific IOCTL code for the operation. The IOCTL code can be up to a 16-bit quantity.

<P>If a SAN service provider supports quality of service (QoS), retrieves the QoS structure associated with the socket. The input buffer is optional. Some protocols, such as RSVP, require the input buffer to qualify a QoS request. The SAN service provider copies the QoS structure into the output buffer.

<P>If a SAN service provider supports QoS, retrieves the QoS structure associated with the socket group to which this socket belongs. The input buffer is optional. Some protocols, such as RSVP, require the input buffer to qualify a QoS request. The SAN service provider copies the QoS structure into the output buffer. If the socket that was specified in the <B>WSPIoctl</B> call does not belong to an appropriate socket group, the SAN service provider sets the <B>SendingFlowspec</B> and <B>ReceivingFlowspec</B> members of the QoS structure to NULL.

<P>If a SAN service provider supports QoS, establishes the supplied QoS structure with the socket group to which this socket belongs. The switch does not require an output buffer; the SAN service provider retrieves the QoS structure from the input buffer. 


<P>The SAN service provider returns the WSAENOPROTOOPT error code if it does not support QoS or if the specified socket descriptor is not the creator of the associated socket group.

<DT>SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_QUERY</DT>

<DD>Partition settings: <B>O</B>==1(set), <B>I</B>==1(set), <B>T</B>==01 

<P>Retrieves a list of local IP addresses that are assigned to the network interface cards (NICs) that the SAN service provider services. The SAN service provider uses a SOCKET_ADDRESS_LIST structure, defined as follows, to return the list in the output buffer. 


<PRE>typedef struct _SOCKET_ADDRESS_LIST {
  INT  iAddressCount; 
  SOCKET_ADDRESS  Address[1]; 
} SOCKET_ADDRESS_LIST, FAR * LPSOCKET_ADDRESS_LIST;</PRE>


<P>The members of this structure contain the following information: 


<DL>
<DT><B>iAddressCount</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of address structures in the list. </DD>

<DT><B>Address</B></DT>

<DD>Array of IP address structures. </DD>
</DL>


<P>The switch uses this IOCTL code internally to decide whether to use a given SAN service provider to execute an application’s requests to make connections or to listen for incoming connections. The switch only forwards actual application requests for the list of local IP addresses to the TCP/IP provider. The switch also uses the SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE IOCTL code with the TCP/IP service provider to detect changes in address lists that all SAN service providers service. After TCP/IP reports a change, through either overlapped I/O or the FD_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE event, the switch uses the SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_QUERY IOCTL code to query all SAN service providers to refresh their lists. 


<P>If the output buffer is not large enough to contain the address list, the SAN service provider returns SOCKET_ERROR and, at <I>lpErrno</I>, the WSAEFAULT error code. The SAN service provider also returns the size of the output buffer that it requires in the variable at <I>lpcbBytesReturned</I>.

</DD>
</DL>

<P>The switch always makes a blocking <B>WSPIoctl</B> call using the SIO_GET_EXTENSION_POINTER and SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_QUERY IOCTL codes. That is, the switch does not use overlapped I/O. However, the switch makes a nonblocking <B>WSPIoctl</B> call using the SIO_GET_QOS and SIO_SET_QOS IOCTL codes and any completion method that the overlying application specifies. The following paragraphs discuss SAN service provider requirements regarding completion of overlapped <B>WSPIoctl</B> calls. </P>

<H4>Overlapped Socket I/O</H4>

<P>If the switch specifies NULL for a completion routine, the SAN service provider should call the <B>WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest</B> function in the context of an arbitrary thread to complete the request. Either the switch or the Windows Sockets DLL can intercept the <B>WPUCompleteOverlappedRequest</B> call. After intercepting this call, the intercepting entity uses the notification mechanism that was requested by the application to signal completion of the request. This notification mechanism can be an event or a completion port. The switch specifies an overlapped structure and NULL for a completion routine to issue most requests. However, requests from applications for the switch to forward QoS information directly to a SAN service provider can use any completion notification mechanism. If a SAN service provider does not support QoS, this situation should never arise. </P>

<P>If the low order bit of the <B>hEvent</B> member in the <A HREF="wsdpref_4xo2.htm">WSAOVERLAPPED</A> structure is set, an application or the switch specifically requests to not be notified with a completion port. If the remainder of <B>hEvent</B> is NULL as well, excluding the low order bit, the SAN service provider can assume that the I/O request requires no completion notification. In this case, the calling entity calls the <B>WSPGetOverlappedResult</B> function to poll for completion. For more information, see the <B>CreateIoCompletionPort</B> and <B>GetQueuedCompletionStatus</B> functions in the Platform SDK documentation. </P>

<P>If the switch specifies a non-NULL completion routine, the SAN service provider ignores the <B>hEvent</B> member in the WSAOVERLAPPED structure. Therefore, the switch can use <B>hEvent</B> to pass context information to the completion routine. An application that initiates a request with a non-NULL completion routine and later calls the <B>WSAGetOverlappedResult</B> function for that request cannot specify that the <B>WSAGetOverlappedResult</B> call wait for the request to complete. That is, the application cannot specify TRUE for the <I>fWait</I> parameter in the <B>WSAGetOverlappedResult</B> call. In this case, usage of <B>hEvent</B> is undefined, and attempting to wait on <B>hEvent</B> produces unpredictable results. </P>

<P>If the switch forwards a request, along with a non-NULL completion routine, in the <B>WSPIoctl</B> call, the SAN service provider must initiate the completion routine after the request completes. Because the completion routine must be executed in the context of the same thread that initiated the request, the SAN service provider cannot directly call the completion routine. The Windows Sockets interface offers an asynchronous procedure call (APC) mechanism to facilitate invocation of completion routines. This APC mechanism is the <B>WPUQueueApc</B> function. A SAN service provider calls <B>WPUQueueApc</B> to arrange for the execution of a completion routine in the proper thread and process context. The SAN service provider can call <B>WPUQueueApc</B> from any process and thread context, even a context different from the thread and process used to initiate the request. </P>

<P>The SAN service provider passes to <B>WPUQueueApc</B> the pointer to the WSATHREADID structure that the switch supplied in the <B>WSPIoctl</B> call. The SAN service provider also passes to <B>WPUQueueApc</B> a pointer to an APC function to be invoked and a 32-bit context value that is subsequently passed to the APC function. Because only a single 32-bit context value is available, the APC function cannot be the original completion routine. Rather, the SAN service provider must supply a pointer to its own APC function. This APC function uses the supplied context value to access the required result information for the original request and then calls the original completion routine. </P>
