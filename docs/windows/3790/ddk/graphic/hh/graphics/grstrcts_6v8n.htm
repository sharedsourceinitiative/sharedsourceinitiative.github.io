<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>dmDeviceName</B></DT>

<DD>For a display, specifies the name of the display driver's DLL; for example, "perm3dd" for the 3Dlabs Permedia3 display driver.

<P>For a printer, specifies the "friendly name"; for example, "PCL/HP LaserJet" in the case of PCL/HP LaserJet®. If the name is greater than CCHDEVICENAME characters in length, the spooler truncates it to fit in the array.
</DD>

<DT><B>dmSpecVersion</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the version number of this DEVMODEW structure. The current version number is identified by the DM_SPECVERSION constant in <I>wingdi.h</I>.</DD>

<DT><B>dmDriverVersion</B></DT>

<DD>For a printer, specifies the printer driver version number assigned by the printer driver developer.

<P>Display drivers can set this member to DM_SPECVERSION.  
</DD>

<DT><B>dmSize</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the size in bytes of the public DEVMODEW structure, not including any private, driver-specified members identified by the <B>dmDriverExtra</B> member.</DD>

<DT><B>dmDriverExtra</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of bytes of private driver data that follow the public structure members. If a device driver does not provide private DEVMODEW members, this member should be set to zero.</DD>

<DT><B>dmFields</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies bit flags identifying which of the following DEVMODEW members are in use. For example, the DM_ORIENTATION flag is set when the <B>dmOrientation</B> member contains valid data. The DM_XXX flags are defined in <I>wingdi.h</I>.</DD>

<DT><B>dmOrientation</B></DT>

<DD>For printers, specifies the paper orientation. This member can be either DMORIENT_PORTRAIT or DMORIENT_LANDSCAPE.

<P>This member is not used for displays.
</DD>

<DT><B>dmPaperSize</B></DT>

<DD>For printers, specifies the size of the paper to be printed on. This member must be zero if the length and width of the paper are specified by the <B>dmPaperLength</B> and <B>dmPaperWidth</B> members. Otherwise, the <B>dmPaperSize</B> member must be one of the DMPAPER-prefixed constants defined in <I>wingdi.h</I>.

<P>This member is not used for displays.
</DD>

<DT><B>dmPaperLength</B></DT>

<DD>For printers, specifies the length of the paper, in units of 1/10 of a millimeter. This value overrides the length of the paper specified by the <B>dmPaperSize</B> member, and is used if the paper is of a custom size, or if the device is a dot matrix printer, which can print a page of arbitrary length.

<P>This member is not used for displays.
</DD>

<DT><B>dmPaperWidth</B></DT>

<DD>For printers, specifies the width of the paper, in units of 1/10 of a millimeter. This value overrides the width of the paper specified by the <B>dmPaperSize</B> member. This member must be used if <B>dmPaperLength</B> is used.

<P>This member is not used for displays.
</DD>

<DT><B>dmScale</B></DT>

<DD>For printers, specifies the percentage by which the image is to be scaled for printing. The image's page size is scaled to the physical page by a factor of <B>dmScale</B>/100. For example, a 17-inch by 22-inch image with a scale value of 100 requires 17x22-inch paper, while the same image with a scale value of 50 should print as half-sized and fit on letter-sized paper.

<P>This member is not used for displays.

<DD>This member is defined only for Windows&nbsp;XP and later. 

<P>For fixed-resolution displays, specifies how the device can present a lower-resolution mode on a higher-resolution display. For example, if a display device's resolution is fixed at 1024 X 768, and its mode is set to 640 x 480, the device can either display a 640 X 480 image within the 1024 X 768 screen space, or stretch the 640 X 480 image to fill the larger screen space. 


<P>When the DM_DISPLAYFIXEDOUTPUT bit is not set in the <B>dmFields</B> member, this member must be set to zero. When the DM_DISPLAYFIXEDOUTPUT bit is set in the <B>dmFields</B> member, this member must be set to one of the following values:

<P>The DEVMODEW structure is the Unicode version of the DEVMODE structure (described in the Platform SDK documentation). While applications can use either the ANSI or Unicode version of the structure, drivers are required to use the Unicode version.</P>

<P>For printer drivers, the DEVMODEW structure is used for specifying printer characteristics required by a print document. It is also used for specifying a printer's default characteristics.</P>

<P>Immediately following a DEVMODEW structure's defined members (often referred to as its public members), there can be a set of driver-defined members (often referred to as private DEVMODEW members). The driver supplies the size, in bytes, of this private area in <B>dmDriverExtra</B>. Driver-defined private members are for exclusive use by the driver. The starting address for the private members can be referenced using the <B>dmSize</B> member as follows:</P>

<PRE>PVOID pvDriverData = (PVOID) (((BYTE *) pdm) + (pdm-&gt;dmSize));
</PRE>

<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Windows&nbsp;2000, a new <B>union</B> member was added to the DEVMODEW structure. This <B>union</B> member contains an existing DEVMODEW structure member, <B>dmDisplayFlags</B>, together with a new member, <B>dmNup</B>. This member is described in the preceding <B>Members</B> section.</P>

<P class=note>In Windows&nbsp;XP, a new <B>struct</B> member was added. This <B>struct</B> member contains an existing DEVMODEW structure member, <B>dmPosition</B>, together with two new members, <B>dmDisplayOrientation</B> and <B>dmDisplayFixedOutput</B>. These members are described in the preceding <B>Members</B> section. </P>

<P class=note>Also for Windows&nbsp;XP, several members of the DEVMODEW structure were moved to different locations in this structure. The <B>dmScale</B>, <B>dmCopies</B>, <B>dmDefaultSource</B>, and <B>dmPrintQuality</B> members were appended to the <B>struct</B> member containing the <B>dmOrientation</B>, <B>dmPaperSize</B>, <B>dmPaperLength</B>, and <B>dmPaperWidth</B> members. </P>
