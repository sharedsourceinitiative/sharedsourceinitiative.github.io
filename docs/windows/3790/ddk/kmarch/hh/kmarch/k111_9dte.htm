</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=49%>FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_NONALERT</TD>
<TD width=51%>All operations on the file are performed synchronously. Waits in the system to synchronize I/O queuing and completion are not subject to alerts.

<H4>Return Value</H4>

<P><B>ZwCreateFile</B> either returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status. If it returns an error status, the caller can find more information about the cause of the failure by checking the <I>IoStatusBlock</I>.</P>

<H4>Comments</H4>

<P>The handle, given by <B>ZwCreateFile</B>, can be used by subsequent calls to manipulate data within the file or the file object's state or attributes. For example, a driver might call this routine during initialization to open a file of microcode for its device.</P>

<P>There are two alternate ways to specify the name of the file to be created or opened with <B>ZwCreateFile</B>:

<OL>
	<LI>As a fully qualified pathname, supplied in the <B>ObjectName</B> member of the input <I>ObjectAttributes</I></LI>

	<LI>As pathname relative to the directory file represented by the handle in the <B>RootDirectory </B>member of the input <I>ObjectAttributes</I></LI>
</OL>

<P>Certain <I>DesiredAccess</I> flags and combinations of flags have the following effects:

<UL>
	<LI>For a caller to synchronize an I/O completion by waiting on the returned <I>FileHandle</I>, the SYNCHRONIZE flag must be set. Otherwise, a caller that is a device or intermediate driver must synchronize an I/O completion by using an event object.</LI>

	<LI>If only the FILE_APPEND_DATA and SYNCHRONIZE flags are set, the caller can write only to the end of the file, and any offset information on writes to the file is ignored. However, the file will automatically be extended as necessary for this type of write operation.</LI>

	<LI>Setting the FILE_WRITE_DATA flag for a file also allows writes beyond the end of the file to occur. The file is automatically extended for this type of write, as well.</LI>

	<LI>If only the FILE_EXECUTE and SYNCHRONIZE flags are set, the caller cannot directly read or write any data in the file using the returned <I>FileHandle</I>: that is, all operations on the file occur through the system pager in response to instruction and data accesses. Device and intermediate drivers should not set the FILE_EXECUTE flag in <I>DesiredAccess</I>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <I>ShareAccess</I> parameter determines whether separate threads can access the same file, possibly simultaneously. Provided that both file openers have the privilege to access a file in the specified manner, the file can be successfully opened and shared. If the original caller of <B>ZwCreateFile</B> does not specify FILE_SHARE_READ<I>, </I>FILE_SHARE_WRITE<I>, </I>or<I> </I>FILE_SHARE_DELETE<I>,</I> no other open operations can be performed on the file: that is, the original caller is given exclusive access to the file.</P>

<P>In order for a shared file to be successfully opened, the requested <I>DesiredAccess</I> to the file must be compatible with both the <I>DesiredAccess</I> and <I>ShareAccess</I> specifications of all preceding opens that have not yet been released with <A HREF="k111_03aq.htm"><B>ZwClose</B></A>. That is, the <I>DesiredAccess</I> specified to <B>ZwCreateFile</B> for a given file must not conflict with the accesses that other openers of the file have disallowed.</P>

<P>The <I>CreateDisposition</I> value FILE_SUPERSEDE requires that the caller have DELETE access to a existing file object. If so, a successful call to <B>ZwCreateFile</B> with FILE_SUPERSEDE on an existing file effectively deletes that file, and then recreates it. This implies that, if the file has already been opened by another thread, it opened the file by specifying a <I>ShareAccess </I>parameter with the FILE_SHARE_DELETE flag set. Note that this type of disposition is consistent with the POSIX style of overwriting files.</P>

<P>The <I>CreateDisposition</I> values FILE_OVERWRITE_IF and FILE_SUPERSEDE are similar. If <B>ZwCreateFile</B> is called with a existing file and either of these <I>CreateDisposition</I> values, the file will be replaced.</P>

<P>Overwriting a file is semantically equivalent to a supersede operation, except for the following:

<UL>
	<LI>The caller must have write access to the file, rather than delete access. This implies that, if the file has already been opened by another thread, it opened the file with the FILE_SHARE_WRITE flag set in the input <I>ShareAccess</I>.</LI>

	<LI>The specified file attributes are logically ORed with those already on the file. This implies that, if the file has already been opened by another thread, a subsequent caller of <B>ZwCreateFile</B> cannot disable existing <I>FileAttributes</I> flags but can enable additional flags for the same file. Note that this style of overwriting files is consistent with MS-DOS®, Windows® 3.1, and with OS/2.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <I>CreateOptions</I> FILE_DIRECTORY_FILE value specifies that the file to be created or opened is a directory file. When a directory file is created, the file system creates an appropriate structure on the disk to represent an empty directory for that particular file system's on-disk structure. If this option was specified and the given file to be opened is not a directory file, or if the caller specified an inconsistent <I>CreateOptions</I> or <I>CreateDisposition</I> value, the call to <B>ZwCreateFile</B> will fail.</P>

<P>The <I>CreateOptions</I> FILE_NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING flag prevents the file system from performing any intermediate buffering on behalf of the caller. Specifying this value places certain restrictions on the caller's parameters to other <B>Zw..File</B> routines, including the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Any optional <I>ByteOffset</I> passed to <A HREF="k111_8ype.htm"><B>ZwReadFile</B></A> or <A HREF="k111_68fm.htm"><B>ZwWriteFile</B></A> must be an integral of the sector size.</LI>

	<LI>The <I>Length</I> passed to <B>ZwReadFile</B> or <B>ZwWriteFile</B>, must be an integral of the sector size. Note that specifying a read operation to a buffer whose length is exactly the sector size might result in a lesser number of significant bytes being transferred to that buffer if the end of the file was reached during the transfer.</LI>

	<LI>Buffers must be aligned in accordance with the alignment requirement of the underlying device. This information can be obtained by calling <B>ZwCreateFile</B> to get a handle for the file object that represents the physical device, and then calling <A HREF="k111_9pyq.htm"><B>ZwQueryInformationFile</B></A> with that handle. For a list of the system FILE_<I>XXX</I>_ALIGNMENT values, see <A HREF="k112_32cy.htm">DEVICE_OBJECT</A>.</LI>

	<LI>Calls to <A HREF="k111_7xyq.htm"><B>ZwSetInformationFile</B></A> with the <I>FileInformationClass</I> parameter set to <B>FilePositionInformation</B> must specify an offset that is an integral of the sector size.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <I>CreateOptions</I> FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_ALERT and FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_NONALERT, which are mutually exclusive as their names suggest, specify that all I/O operations on the file are to be synchronous as long as they occur through the file object referred to by the returned <I>FileHandle</I>. All I/O on such a file is serialized across all threads using the returned handle. With either of these <I>CreateOptions</I>, the <I>DesiredAccess</I> SYNCHRONIZE flag must be set so that the I/O Manager will use the file object as a synchronization object. With either of these <I>CreateOptions</I> set, the I/O Manager maintains the "file position context" for the file object, an internal, current file position offset. This offset can be used in calls to <B>ZwReadFile</B> and <B>ZwWriteFile</B>. Its position also can be queried or set with <B>ZwQueryInformationFile</B> and <B>ZwSetInformationFile</B>.</P>

<P>Driver routines that run in a process context other than that of the system process must set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute for the <I>ObjectAttributes</I> parameter of <B>ZwCreateFile</B>. This restricts the use of the handle returned by <B>ZwCreateFile</B> to processes running only in kernel mode. Otherwise, the handle can be accessed by the process in whose context the driver is running. Drivers can call <A HREF="k109_66uq.htm"><B>InitializeObjectAttributes</B></A> to set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute as follows.</P>

<PRE>InitializeObjectAttributes(&amp;ObjectAttributes, NULL, OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE, NULL, NULL);
</PRE>

<P>Callers of <B>ZwCreateFile</B> must be running at IRQL&nbsp;= PASSIVE_LEVEL.</P>
