<H4>Members</H4>

<DL>
<DT><B>wDecodedPictureIndex</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the destination frame buffer for the decoded macroblocks.</DD>

<DT><B>wDeblockedPictureIndex</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the destination frame buffer for the deblocked output picture when <B>bPicDeblocked</B> is 1. This member has no meaning and must be zero if <B>bPicDeblocked</B> is zero. This member may be the same as <B>wDecodedPictureIndex</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>wForwardRefPictureIndex</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the frame buffer index of the picture to be used as a reference picture for forward prediction of the current picture. Must not be the same as <B>wDecodedPictureIndex</B>. This member must be 0xFFFF if <B>bPicIntra</B> is 1.</DD>

<DT><B>wBackwardRefPictureIndex</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the frame buffer index of the picture to be used as a reference picture for backward prediction of the current picture. This member must not be the same as <B>wDecodedPictureIndex</B> if backward reference motion prediction is used. This member must be 0xFFFF if <B>bPicBackwardPrediction</B> is zero.</DD>

<DT><B>wPicWidthInMBminus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the width of the current picture in units of macroblocks, minus 1. The width of the picture in macroblocks is derived by adding 1 to <B>wPicWidthInMBminus1</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>wPicHeightInMBminus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the height of the current picture in units of macroblocks, minus 1. The height of the picture in macroblocks is derived by adding 1 to <B>wPicHeightInMBminus1</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>bMacroblockWidthMinus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the destination luminance sample width of a macroblock, minus 1. This is equal to 15 for MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.263, and MPEG-4.</DD>

<DT><B>bMacroblockHeightMinus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the destination luminance sample height of a macroblock, minus 1. This is equal to 15 for MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, H.263, and MPEG-4.</DD>

<DT><B>bBlockWidthMinus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the block width of a residual difference block minus 1. This is equal to 7 for MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, H.263, and MPEG-4. This is 7 if the <B>bConfig4GroupedCoefs</B> member of the <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> structure is 1. Residual difference blocks within a macroblock are sent in the order specified as in MPEG-2 Figures 6-10, 6-11, and 6-12 (raster-scan order for Y, followed by all 4:2:0 blocks of Cb in raster-scan order, followed by 4:2:0 blocks of Cr, followed by 4:2:2 blocks of Cb, followed by 4:2:2 blocks of Cr, followed by 4:4:4 blocks of Cb, followed by 4:4:4 blocks of Cr). A derived term called <I>W<SUB>T</SUB></I> is formed by adding 1 to <B>bBlockWidthMinus1</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>bBlockHeightMinus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the block height of a residual difference block, minus 1. This is equal to 7 for MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, H.263, and MPEG-4. This is 7 if <B>bConfig4GroupedCoefs</B> is 1. A derived term called <I>H<SUB>T</SUB></I> is formed by adding 1 to <B>bBlockHeightMinus1</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>bBPPminus1</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the number of bits per pixel for the video sample values, minus 1. This is at least 7 (indicating 8-bit pixels). This is equal to 7 for MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, and H.263. A larger number of bits per pixel is supported in some operational modes of MPEG-4. A derived term called <I>BPP</I> is formed by adding 1 to <B>bBPPminus1</B>.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicStructure</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether the current picture is a top-field picture (a value 1), a bottom-field picture (a value 2), or a frame picture (a value 3). In progressive-scan frame-structured coding such as in H.261, <B>bPicStructure</B> is 3. A derived value <I>PicCurrentField</I> is defined as zero unless <B>bPicStructure</B> is 2 (bottom field). In which case, it is 1. This member has the same meaning as the <I>picture_structure </I>variable defined in Section 6.3.10 and Table 6-14 of <A HREF="dxvaguide_4693.htm">MPEG-2 (H.262)</A>.</DD>

<DT><B>bSecondField</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether, in the case of field-structured coding (when <B>bPicStructure</B> is 1 or 2), the current field is the second field of a picture. This is used to determine whether the opposite-parity field used as a reference for the opposite-parity lines for motion compensation prediction is the opposite-parity field of the reference picture or the opposite-parity field of the current picture. If <B>bSecondField</B> is 1, the current field is the second field of a picture and the field used as a reference for the opposite-parity lines for motion compensation are the opposite-parity lines of the current picture. (In both cases, the field used as a reference for the same-parity lines for motion compensation are the same-parity lines of the reference picture.) Otherwise, <B>bSecondField</B> is zero.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicIntra</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether motion-compensated prediction is needed for this picture. If <B>bPicIntra</B> is 1, all macroblocks are sent with either the <A HREF="dxvaref_0qsn.htm">DXVA_MBctrl_I_OffHostIDCT_1</A> or <A HREF="dxvaref_5wo7.htm">DXVA_MBctrl_I_HostResidDiff_1</A> macroblock control command structure, in which the <I>IntraMacroblock</I> flag is equal to 1 . That is, no motion-compensated prediction is performed for the picture. Otherwise, some macroblocks of the picture may have the <I>IntraMacroblock</I> parameter of the macroblock control command equal to zero, and the macroblock control command structure will use the <A HREF="dxvaref_9t0n.htm">DXVA_MBctrl_P_HostResidDiff_1</A> structure or the <A HREF="dxvaref_4rl3.htm">DXVA_MBctrl_P_OffHostIDCT_1</A> structure.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicBackwardPrediction</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether any macroblocks of the current picture might include backward prediction. If <B>bPicIntra</B> is 1, <B>bPicBackwardPrediction</B> must be zero. If <B>bPicBackwardPrediction</B> is zero, <I>MotionBackward</I> must be zero in all macroblock control commands of the picture (within each DXVA_MBctrl_I_HostResidDiff_1, DXVA_MBctrl_I_OffHostIDCT_1, DXVA_MBctrl_P_HostResidDiff_1, or DXVA_MBctrl_P_OffHostIDCT_1 structure). If <B>bPicBackwardPrediction</B> is 1, some macroblocks of the picture may have <I>MotionBackward</I> equal to 1.</DD>

<DT><B>bBidirectionalAveragingMode</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the rounding method for combining prediction planes in bidirectional motion compensation (used for B pictures and dual-prime motion). The value zero indicates MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 rounded averaging (in which values halfway between two integers are rounded upward to the next higher integer), and the value 1 indicates H.263 truncated averaging (in which values halfway between two integers are rounded downward to the next lower integer). <B>bBidirectionalAveragingMode</B> must be zero if no bidirectional averaging is needed.</DD>

<DT><B>bMVprecisionAndChromaRelation</B></DT>

<DD>This member indicates the precision of luminance motion vectors and how chrominance motion vectors are derived from luminance motion vectors.

<P>The following table lists values for this member with the specified luminance motion vector precision and a description of how the chrominance motion vectors are derived.

</DD>

<DT><B>bChromaFormat</B></DT>

<DD>Affects the number of prediction error blocks expected by the accelerator. This variable is defined in MPEG-2 (H.262). For <A HREF="dxvaguide_6813.htm">MPEG-1</A>, MPEG-2 Main Profile, H.261 and H.263 bitstreams, this value must always be set to 1, indicating 4:2:0 format. If a value of 2, this indicates 4:2:2, and if a value of 3, indicates 4:4:4 sampling. This member must be equal to 1 if the <B>bConfig4GroupedCoefs</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> is 1 (because <B>bConfig4GroupedCoefs</B> operation does not include the EOB indication needed within coefficient data in 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 formats).


<P class=note><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizontal chroma siting differs slightly among H.261, H.263, and MPEG-1 versus MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. This difference is assumed to be small enough to ignore.

</DD>

<DT><B>bPicScanFixed</B></DT>

<DD>When using accelerator-based IDCT processing of residual difference blocks, a value of 1 for this flag indicates that the inverse-scan method is the same for all macroblocks in the picture. A value of zero indicates that it is not. This member must be 1 if the <B>bConfigHostInverseScan</B> member is 1 or if the <B>bConfigResidDiffAccelerator</B> member is zero in DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicScanMethod</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the fixed inverse scan method for the picture when <B>bPicScanFixed</B> is 1. When <B>bPicScanFixed</B> is zero, this member has no meaning and must have a value of zero.

<P>If the <B>bConfigHostInverseScan</B> member of DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode is zero, the scan method defined by this member can be one of the following.

<DT><B>bPicReadbackRequests</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether read-back control requests are issued for the current picture. A value of 1 indicates that read-back requests are present, and a value of zero indicates that they are not. Read-back requests indicate that values of macroblocks are read back in the final decoded and deblocked picture (if deblocking is applied with <B>wDeblockedPictureIndex</B> equal to <B>wDecodedPictureIndex</B>). </DD>

<DT><B>bRcontrol</B></DT>

<DD>Defines the rounding method to be used for half-sample motion compensation. This variable is defined in H.263 Section 6.1.2. A value of zero indicates the half-sample rounding method found in MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and the first version of H.263. A value of 1 indicates the rounding method that includes a downward averaging bias that can be selected in some optional modes of H.263 and MPEG-4. It is meaningless for H.261, because H.261 has no half-sample motion compensation. It must be set to zero for all MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 bitstreams in order to conform with the rounding operator defined by those standards.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicSpatialResid8</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates how spatial-domain difference blocks are sent to the accelerator from the host. A value of 1 indicates that spatial-domain difference blocks for host-based residual difference decoding can be sent using 8-bit samples, and a value of zero indicates that they cannot. 

<P>This member must be zero if the <B>bConfigResidDiffHost</B> member of <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> is zero or if <I>BPP</I> is greater than 8. This member must be 1 if <I>BPP</I> is 8, <B>bPicIntra</B> is 1 and <B>bConfigResidDiffHost</B> is 1. This member must be 1 if the <B>bConfigSpatialResid8</B> member of DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode is 1. 


<P>If this member is equal to 1, spatial-domain intra macroblocks are sent as 8-bit values (that are either signed or unsigned, as determined by the <B>bConfigIntraResidUnsigned</B> member of DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode), and spatial-domain nonintra macroblock differences are sent as signed 8-bit difference values relative to some motion-compensated prediction.


<P>The <B>bPicSpatialResid8</B> member differs from the <B>bConfigSpatialResid8</B> member of DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode in that it is an indication for a particular picture, not a global indication for the entire video sequence. In some cases such as in an intra picture with <I>BPP</I> equal to 8, <B>bPicSpatialResid8</B> will be 1 even though <B>bConfigSpatialResid8</B> may be zero.
</DD>

<DT><B>bPicOverflowBlocks</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether spatial-domain difference blocks are sent to the accelerator from the host using overflow blocks. A value of 1 indicates that spatial-domain difference blocks for host-based residual difference decoding of a picture may be sent using overflow blocks. A value of zero indicates that spatial-domain difference blocks are not sent using overflow blocks. This member must be zero if <B>bConfigResidDiffHost</B> is zero or if <B>bConfigSpatialResid8</B> is zero, or if <I>BPP</I> is greater than 8. Parameters <B>bConfigResidDiffHost</B> and <B>bConfigSpatialResid8</B> are members of <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A>. <B>bPicOverflowBlocks</B> indicates whether any overflow blocks may be present for the particular picture. In an intra picture with <I>BPP</I> equal to 8, <B>bPicOverflowBlocks</B> must be zero as no overflow blocks are needed in this case.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicExtrapolation</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether motion vectors over picture boundaries are allowed as specified by H.263 Annex D and MPEG-4. This requires either allocation of picture planes that are two macroblocks wider (one extra macroblock at the left and another at the right) and two macroblocks taller (one extra macroblock at the top and another at the bottom) than the decoded picture size, or clipping of the address of each individual pixel access to within the picture boundaries. Macroblock addresses in this specification are for macroblocks in the interior of the picture, not including padding.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicDeblocked</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether deblocking commands are sent for this picture to create a deblocked output picture. The deblocked output picture is placed in the picture buffer indicated by <B>wDeblockedPictureIndex</B>. If <B>bPicDeblocked</B> is 1, deblocking commands are sent and the deblocked frame is generated. If <B>bPicDeblocked</B> is zero, no deblocking commands are sent and no deblocked picture is generated.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicDeblockConfined</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates whether deblocking filter command buffers confine the effect of deblocking filter operations to the set of macroblocks contained in the deblocking filter command buffer. </DD>

<DT><B>bPic4MVallowed</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies whether four forward-reference motion vectors per macroblock are allowed as used in H.263 Annexes F and J.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicOBMC</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies whether motion compensation for the current picture operates using overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) as specified in H.263 Annex F. Must be zero if <B>bPic4MVallowed</B> is zero.</DD>

<DT><B>bPicBinPB</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies whether bidirectionally predicted macroblocks in the picture use B-picture in PB-frame motion compensation. This restricts the bidirectionally predicted area for each macroblock to the region of the corresponding macroblock in the backward reference picture, as specified in Annexes G and M of H.263.</DD>

<DT><B>bMV_RPS</B></DT>

<DD>Specifies the use of motion vector reference picture selection. If <B>bMV_RPS</B> is 1, this indicates that a reference picture index is sent for each motion vector rather than just forward and possibly backward motion picture indexes for the picture as a whole. If <B>bMV_RPS</B> is 1, the <B>wForwardRefPictureIndex</B> and <B>wBackwardRefPictureIndex</B> members have no meaning and must be zero.</DD>

<DT><B>bReservedBits</B></DT>

<DD>This is reserved for packing and alignment. Must be zero.</DD>

<DT><B>wBitstreamFcodes</B></DT>

<DD>Indicates the motion vector <I>f_code</I> values as defined in MPEG-2 for raw bitstream processing. Each <I>f_code</I> value takes 4 bits. These values are packed into a 16-bit word as follows.

<DD>Indicates the likelihood of errors in the bitstream data when the <B>bConfigBitstreamRaw</B> member of the <A HREF="dxvaref_3vdz.htm">DXVA_ConfigPictureDecode</A> structure is 1. Must be zero if <B>bConfigBitstreamRaw</B> is zero.

<P>Video accelerators must be designed not to fail or lock up, regardless of the content of the data given to them. Therefore, it may be helpful for a video accelerator to have information about the host’s assessment of the likelihood of syntactical errors. This is in order to determine whether there is a need to invoke a more complex error concealment algorithm that might slow down the bitstream decoding process. Allowed values for this member are as follows (all other values are reserved).
